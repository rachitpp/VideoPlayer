# Git Strategy for VideoPlayer Project

This document outlines the version control strategy I would implement for continued development of the Lecture Video Progress Tracker application.

## Repository Structure

```
video-player/
├── main             # Production-ready branch
├── development      # Integration and testing branch
└── feature/         # Feature-specific branches
    ├── interval-tracking
    ├── ui-enhancements
    ├── offline-support
    └── etc.
```

## Branching Strategy

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code that's been thoroughly tested
- **development**: Integration branch where features are combined and tested
- **feature/x**: Individual feature branches for isolated development
- **bugfix/x**: Specific branches for bug fixes
- **hotfix/x**: Emergency fixes that go directly to main

## Commit Best Practices

1. **Small, Focused Commits**

   - Each commit should represent one logical change
   - Example: "Fix interval calculation when user seeks backward in video"

2. **Descriptive Commit Messages**

   - Format: `[Component] Brief description of what changed`
   - Examples:
     - `[VideoPlayer] Add buffer indicator during loading states`
     - `[useVideoProgress] Fix edge case in interval merging algorithm`
     - `[API] Improve error handling for network timeouts`

3. **Commit Message Structure**

   ```
   Short summary of changes (50 chars or less)

   More detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
   Focus on the reasoning rather than how it was implemented.

   - Include bullet points for multiple changes
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable (#123)
   ```

## Example Development Workflow

For implementing a new feature like offline mode:

```bash
# Create a feature branch from development
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/offline-mode

# Make small, targeted changes with focused commits
# 1. First, add local storage persistence
git add client/src/hooks/useVideoProgress.js
git commit -m "[Progress] Add enhanced local storage fallback mechanism"

# 2. Add IndexedDB support for larger storage
git add client/src/utils/indexedDBStorage.js
git commit -m "[Storage] Create IndexedDB wrapper for offline video data"

# 3. Update UI to show offline status
git add client/src/components/VideoPlayer.jsx
git add client/src/components/OfflineIndicator.jsx
git commit -m "[UI] Add offline mode indicator and status messages"

# Merge changes back to development when the feature is complete
git checkout development
git pull origin development  # Get any changes made while working
git merge --no-ff feature/offline-mode
git push origin development

# After testing in development branch, merge to main for release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff development
git push origin main
```

## Code Review Process

1. For significant features, create pull requests instead of direct merges
2. Require at least one code review before merging to development
3. Run automated tests before approving any merge
4. Use GitHub's review features to comment on specific lines of code

## Tagging and Releases

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Tag significant releases:
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial stable release with core functionality"
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```

## Planned Branch Structure for Next Features

1. **feature/mobile-optimization**

   - Improve responsive design
   - Add touch-friendly controls
   - Optimize playback for mobile networks

2. **feature/analytics-dashboard**

   - Add charts for viewing patterns
   - Track most-watched video segments
   - Visualize progress across all videos

3. **feature/multi-device-sync**

   - Add real-time syncing between devices
   - Implement conflict resolution for overlapping sessions
   - Create device management UI

4. **bugfix/interval-edge-cases**
   - Fix issues with rapid seeking
   - Address progress calculation in very short videos
   - Improve handling of network interruptions

This Git strategy ensures clean, organized development while maintaining a stable main branch ready for deployment at any time.
